1) correct
2) I have a type where I forgot to put the 2 in front of the beta_0 in the second step.
3) I made an error by apply beta_q to the covariate which messed up everything in my algebra. I can see more clearly now how to get to the answer.
4) correct
5) correct
4) correct except I didn't provide both versions of the model and I didn't provide the level of detail you did in the explanation. I couched it in what it means in terms of variance explained rather than what larger and smaller numbers mean for that.
5a) This one confused me. I said that for IQ and GPA, females earn more on average than males. I understood that iii was correct, but I also thought ii was correct. However, as I reflect on the wording, I guess it is true for lower values but not for higher, so it's not true for any fixed value of IQ and GPA and that is what makes it incorrect.
5b) Correct
5c) Correct
6) I left out the violation of the assumption of independence
7a) I misunderstood what you were looking for in this question. I thought your answer was more the definition of random effects and explained how the assumption of normality differs in that the residuals are expected to be normally distributed.
7b) I didn't include the bit about adding a penalty for low values
7c) correct
8a) Correct
8b) correct
8c) I didn't get the same effect size for the size variable because  I only included the random intercept and not the random slope.
8d) My model had a different AIC value without the random slope. I had a similar but slightly different conclusion as a result, but had I gotten the same AIC value I would have come to the conclusion you listed.
9a) Correct
9b) Correct
9c,i,ii,iii) Correct
9d) Correct
9e) Correct
10 all) Correct
11 all) Correct, except I didn't plot the population data
