    "Causal connectives (e.g. because) provide information about the type of relationship that exists between two sentences. However, readers can still infer relationships between clauses without connectives even though such sentences are considered less cohesive and lead to greater processing difficulty. In fact, McNamara et al. (1996) suggested that readers may benefit from less coherent text precisely because the reader must spend additional resources generating the inference on their own. However, this is dependent upon the readersâ€™ ability to make the inference the author intended. We investigated a potential trade-off whereby less cohesive sentences may promote memory for details but at the expense of generating accurate inferences about their relationship. Participants read short expository passages while their eye-movements were tracked. Within the passages, we varied the inclusion of a connective, the order of the clauses (cause-effect versus effect-cause), and the location of the connective (e.g. Because can occur at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence). After reading all of the passages, participants took a memory test asking them to select a correct causal inference and a correct detail for each passage.  The results from such manipulations will add to an understanding of how processing difficulty interacts with inference generation, comprehension, and memory."
